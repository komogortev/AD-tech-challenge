# AD-tech-challenge
A tech challenge to use REST API to pull a number of tweets and display them on the page with some filtering available.
  
  #Features to add/modify
  1. rewrite filter by date so it would render page again from template.
  2. create pagination allowing to request next/previous batch of tweets.
  3. hide UI options that are not available in given screen/device (i.e. layout switch to columns on small screens).
  4. attempt to store page state in cookie if localStorage is not available.
