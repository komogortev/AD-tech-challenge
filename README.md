# AD-tech-challenge
A tech challenge to use REST API to pull a number of tweets and display them on the page with some filtering available.
  
  #Features to add/modify
  1. rewrite filter by date so it would render page again from template 
  2. create pagination allowing to request next/previous batch of tweets
